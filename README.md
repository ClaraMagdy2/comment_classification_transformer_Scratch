## 📖 Project Overview  
This project focuses on **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, utilizing **machine learning and deep learning techniques** to analyze and process text data. The goal is to build a robust NLP model for **[your specific task, e.g., sentiment analysis, text classification, entity recognition]**.  
 
✔️ Preprocessing text data (tokenization, stemming, lemmatization)  
✔️ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations  
✔️ Machine Learning & Deep Learning models for NLP & Build Transformer from Scratch  
✔️ Model evaluation & performance metrics  
✔️ Interactive Jupyter Notebook
